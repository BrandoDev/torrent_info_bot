Introduction
============

Once one of my friend told me: "Why do you don't do a telegram bot to check torrent informations"
So here we are.

Dependencies & Their Versions
============
* ``pip install "python-telegram-bot"`` installs the Telegram library.
* ``pip install "qbittorrent_api"`` installs the qBittorrent Web API

Installation
============
.. code:: shell

    $ git clone https://github.com/BrandoDev/torrent_info_bot.git && pip install -r requirements.txt


Set Up
============

You have to create folders "files" and "logs"
After the first start of the bot, you'll see a config.ini file;
here you have to set up your Telegram Bot Token and something about your qBittorrent Web interface

Demo
============

You can use my telegram bot https://t.me/torrentinfo_bot to check the features
