Introduction
============

Once one of my friend told me: "Why do you don't do a telegram bot to check torrent informations"<br />
So here we are.

Dependencies
============
* ``pip install "python-telegram-bot"`` installs the Telegram library
* ``pip install "qbittorrent_api"`` installs the qBittorrent Web API

Installation
============

    $ git clone https://github.com/BrandoDev/torrent_info_bot.git && pip install -r requirements.txt


Set Up
============

* You have to create folders "files" and "logs"<br />
* After the first start of the bot, you'll see a config.ini file<br />
* Here you have to set up your Telegram Bot Token and something about your qBittorrent Web interface

Demo
============

You can use my telegram bot https://t.me/torrentinfo_bot to check the features
